We have developed a decentralized UNO card game leveraging NEO. By utilizing its robust blockchain capabilities we have built a secure and transparent card gaming environment that adheres to the principles of Web3.

## Problem:
Traditional online card games suffer from trust issues where players doubt the fairness of the game. Centralized platforms often have control over the game mechanics, leading to potential manipulation or lack of transparency. Additionally, the visibility of playersâ€™ hands and decks can compromise the integrity of the game, as some players might gain an unfair advantage.

## Solution:
Our UNO card game, built on NEO addresses these concerns by ensuring that all game mechanics are decentralized and transparent, while the privacy layer guarantees that players' hands and the deck remain hidden. This ensures that no player can gain an unfair advantage, and the integrity of the game is preserved. The integration of a commit-and-reveal mechanism further ensures that all moves are verifiable without compromising privacy.

## Existing work:
We have fully operation game built on an EVM chain [here](https://gameofuno.vercel.app). In this hackathon we wanted to transpose the contract written in solidity into go and deploy on NEO chain to make it performant and secure. We began the work really late leaving us not enough time to complete the porting. Given an opportunity we will complete the build and deploy on NEO chain to demonstrate a new version of UNO - On chain!
